# Unembed Gleam Giveaways

Sometimes some pages have a gleam.io giveaway embedded in them. So, if you have to bookmark it, you have to load the whole page everytime instead of just the giveaway. This script allows you to open the giveaway itself in a new page so that you can bookmark it and don't have to load the whole page every time.

It adds a `ðŸ¡µ` button to the top-right of the giveaway. When you click this button, the giveaway opens in a new tab.

### Note
Even though the screenshot shows an official Gleam.io contest, the script is usable on any page that has a Gleam giveaway embedded in it.
